# CodingQuiz


I was asked to create a coding quiz from scratch. The quiz would be timed giving the user 60 seconds to complete five question quiz. 
For each wrong answer the timer subtracts 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz it reveals the user score and the user is allowed to enter his initials 
to store his score one the web browser.
